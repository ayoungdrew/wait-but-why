# Summary

Wait But Why is a microblogging and social media platform that allows users to tell a story about their life via a timeline of events. Sort of an off-beat LinkedIn. Users create posts called Events which recall past moments when he or she did something - anything really. However, in contrast to LinkedIn where one details the accomplishments or growth of a life event, users examine why the event even happened in the first place, using one of three tags: “It was something I wanted to do”, “I felt like I had to”, or “I had no control over it”, and then further providing their thoughts on the event.

The concept of Wait But Why is to focus on the honest circumstances that brought the user to a particular life event and ultimately where they are today.
